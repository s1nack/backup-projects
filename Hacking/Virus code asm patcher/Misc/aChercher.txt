However, there is a better method to get the kernel32 base memory. 
Using the fs selector, we can get into our PEB. By searching the 
PEB_LDR_DATA structure, we will find the list of DLL which our 
vulnerable program initialized when it start. The list of DLL will be 
loaded in sequence, first, NTDLL, followed by Kernel32. So, by 
traveling one nod forward in the list, we will get the base memory of 
the Kernel32.dll. This technique, complete with the code, has been 
published by researchers in VX-zine, then used by LSD in their 
Windows Assembly component. 

	mov   eax,fs:[30h]		; PEB  base
	mov   eax,[eax+0ch]		; goto PEB_LDR_DATA
	; first entry in InInitializationOrderModuleList
	mov   esi,[eax+1ch] 
	lodsd					; forward to next LIST_ENTRY
	mov   ebx,[eax+08h]		; Kernel32 base memory
