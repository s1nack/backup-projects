## Programs and Scripts

* [Active Directory Audit Script](https://github.com/s1nack/backup-projects/tree/main/Programs%20and%20scripts/Active%20Directory%20audit%20script): PowerShell script with GUI to perform access-rights reviews on MS Active Directory. Generates an Excel report for sensitive and custom AD groups.
* [Remote Administration Tool](https://github.com/s1nack/backup-projects/tree/main/Programs%20and%20scripts/Hybrid%20Remote%20Execution%20Tool): A GUI-based C# program to run commands on multiple Windows and Linux systems (multi-threaded).
* [Linux CLI Support Tool](https://github.com/s1nack/backup-projects/tree/main/Programs%20and%20scripts/Linux%20command%20line%20GUI%20support%20tool): A C program with a GUI in command-line to perform support-related actions (e.g., reverse SSH shell)
* [Misc stuff](https://github.com/s1nack/backup-projects/tree/main/Programs%20and%20scripts/Misc%20stuff): C, Python, Perl and Batch scripts to perform various sysadmin tasks and Linux memory management research

## OSIGNA

[Open-Source Intelligence Scanner](https://github.com/s1nack/backup-projects/tree/main/OSIGNA%20-%20Vulnerability%20and%20OSINT%20Management%20Platform): A web-based application in PHP, Python and NodeJS. Provides an OSINT scanner (domain-based) to find company data leaked on internet (e.g., credentials, sensitive documents) and a vulnerability scanner (based on OpenVAS)

## Machine Learning
