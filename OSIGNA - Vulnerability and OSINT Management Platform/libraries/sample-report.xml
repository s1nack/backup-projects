					<description>The remote service encrypts traffic using TLS / SSL and permits clients to renegotiate connections.  The computational requirements for renegotiating a connection are asymmetrical between the client and the server, with the server performing several times more work. Since the remote host does not appear to limit the number of renegotiations
for a single TLS / SSL connection, this permits a client to open several simultaneous connections and repeatedly renegotiate them,
possibly leading to a denial of service condition.</description>
					<synopsis>The remote service allows repeated renegotiation of TLS / SSL connections.</synopsis>

				<solution>Contact the vendor of the DNS software for a fix.</solution>
				<risk_factor>Medium</risk_factor>
				<description>The remote DNS server responds to queries for third-party domains
that do not have the recursion bit set. 

This may allow a remote attacker to determine which domains have
recently been resolved via this name server, and therefore which hosts
have been recently visited. 

For instance, if an attacker was interested in whether your company
utilizes the online services of a particular financial institution,
they would be able to use this attack to build a statistical model
regarding company usage of that financial institution.  Of course, the
attack can also be used to find B2B partners, web-surfing patterns,
external mail servers, and more.

Note: If this is an internal DNS server not accessable to outside
networks, attacks would be limited to the internal network. This
may include employees, consultants and potentially users on
a guest network or WiFi connection if supported.</description>
